Automatic WoD Object Interaction

This AddOn will automatically interact with a number of the quest and treasure objects
located in Warlords of Draenor. There are some bugs and issues with a few of the 
objects we've found. If you find that the AddOn does not work with a particular object
please email "stinkytwitch@gmail.com" with your Zone, SubZone, Quest (if any) and Object
that gave you problems.

To turn on automatic object interaction either type "/wodobj" in your chat frame
or make a Macro with "/wodobj".

The AddOn defaults to Off upon Loading/Reloading/Portaling. This is to prevent any
disconnects that can sometimes happen.

Lastly you need to have Firehack installed and attached to use this AddOn.
