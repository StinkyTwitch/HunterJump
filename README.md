Hunter Jump

Instead of Disengaging backwards, this AddOn allows the Hunter to Disengage forward like a
Warrior's Heroic Leap.

To use you can type at a chat prompt "/hunterjump" or you can put it into a macro and use a
keybind.

If you run in to any issues please email "stinkytwitch@gmail.com".

Thank you.
